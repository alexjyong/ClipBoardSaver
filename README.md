# ClipBoardSaver
Basic way to save clipboard history. Currently only works for Mac and Windows. Future versions will support Linux.

I take no responsibility for any misuse of this program. I urge all users to inform others if they are using their computer with this script to inform them of it running in the background. I also remind people to be mindful of what they type into strange computers.

Remember that this is saving stuff to a file, so be mindful of what you are copying and pasting! I will be implementing a encryption feature in the near future.
